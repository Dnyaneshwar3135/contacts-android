// Going to use JitPack.io because it's so simple. Less "non-code" in the repo, the better! This
// definitely is in the spirit of Contacts, Reborn! On a side note, we've come a long way...
// Publishing artifacts used to be... a headache. Now it's just come to this XD. All we need to do
// now is apply this script into every library module. That's it... HOW CAN ANYONE NOT BE EXCITED
// ABOUT THIS! IT IS MIND BLOWING! Okay, enough talk. Time for the publish code... But really...
// JitPack + GitHub = LOVE

// Additionally, the maven-publish plugin needs to be applied to the library module.
