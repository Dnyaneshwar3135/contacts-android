# How do I integrate custom data?

TODO

- Provide info on how to show custom data natively in the contacts app.
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider#CustomData

Custom data from social media will also be supported. For more info, read [How do I integrate custom data from social media?](/howto/howto-integrate-custom-data-from-social-media.md)

Custom data without sync adapters will not be synced! For more info, read [How do I sync contact data across devices?](/howto/howto-sync-contact-data.md)

Note for people looking at this file, the code and documentation within the code is already complete. 
I'm in the process of writing these howto pages to provide examples and more explanations on how 
to use the APIs provided in this library.
